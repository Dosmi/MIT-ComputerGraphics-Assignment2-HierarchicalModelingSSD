# MIT-ComputerGraphics-Assignment2-HierarchicalModelingSSD
The focus of this assignment is construction of a hierarchical character model that can be interactively controlled with a user interface. As well as skeletal subspace deformation (SSD, or 'skinning') for attaching a “skin” to a hierarchical skeleton which naturally deforms when we manipulate the skeleton’s joint angles.
